# (notes)
# take cfbteam as inputs
# take cfbuntil2010wins as input
# using BeautifulSoup and tweepy and math
# grab wins since 2011 from "http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/" + cfbteam + "/"
# confirm that latest year = current year
# add up wins 
# add up losses
# add up ties (no adding needed)
# # calculate winning % = ( total wins + total losses / 2 ) / num all games 
# find next 100 win milestone (int(math.ceil(x/100.0))*100)
# winsleft to milestone = milestone - totalwins
# return winsleft to milestone
# predict when will pass next 100 win milestone (= winsleft / winning %) = num-games-to-play
